# Amazon-Product-Recommender-System
Performed sentiment analysis on Amazon Review Dataset available at KAGGLE

The Main Objective of a recommender system is to generate meaningful
recommendations to the users for several products that might interest them.

In our project we are taking into consideration the amazon review dataset for
Clothes, shoes and Beauty products.

I am considering the ratings given by the user to different products as well as
his/her reviews about his/her experience with the product.

Based on these input factors, sentiment analysis is performed on predicting the
helpfulness of the reviews. Moreover, we also designed item-based collaborative
filtering model based on k-Nearest Neighbors to find the 2 most similar items.
